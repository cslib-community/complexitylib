# Arora–Barak draft coverage audit

Audit and checked client: Christian Reitwiessner, with Codex assistance.

This is a growing statement-level audit under [#4711](https://github.com/cslib-community/cslib-frontier/issues/4711),
not a completeness claim for the book or library. Its source is the
[public web draft dated 2007-01-08](https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/book.pdf)
(489 PDF pages; SHA-256 `da0881782a35bde6a0779a2eb1a8d480f39fbddf70bbb92824d1dc5550a033b2`).
Numbers and printed pages below belong to that draft, not the published edition.
The initial automatic extraction found 245 distinct numbered result headings across chapters
1–22; only the chapter-specific records below have been checked to the stated extent.

The results registry remains [Entries.lean](../CslibFrontierResults/Entries.lean). This audit
records absent endpoints, model differences and source problems that a positive-result registry
cannot express by pointing at a theorem. A nearby theorem is not counted as full coverage.

## Chapter 14: algebraic computation models

Snapshot: `b33272859bedf13f13abe0a6e841a56b41807d5f` on 2026-11-12, with CSLib pin
`ee99dd30bd1a9f466c25a51b39a5cb0bfe4d2342`. All eight numbered result headings in the chapter
were checked against the extracted draft text, including the two claims under 14.7.
Library inspection covers the arithmetic circuit modules linked below and neighboring model
modules; searches also checked pinned CSLib and Mathlib for the named algebraic models and
results. Negative search results are qualified: they are not proofs of semantic absence from
every possible general theorem. No whole-library semantic or axiom-dependency audit is claimed.
Here $\kappa(S)$ denotes the draft's component count, not the number of points in $S$.

| Draft result | Printed / PDF page | Disposition and remaining endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| 14.7, determinant part | 258 / 274 | **Source issue; nearby infrastructure.** The literal arbitrary-circuit claim fails the degree check below. Determinant membership in VP and a permanent-to-determinant construction do not establish a corrected formula-universality theorem. |
| 14.7, permanent part | 258 / 274 | **Partial; source conventions need correction.** Permanent membership, formula simulation and a single-entry selector gadget are present. Full completeness remains [#321](https://github.com/cslib-community/cslib-frontier/issues/321). |
| 14.11 | 259 / 275 | **Endpoint not located.** Depth $O(n^5)$ algebraic computation trees for real subset sum; ordinary binary subset-sum reductions are a different model. |
| 14.14 | 260 / 276 | **Endpoint not located.** At least $n!$ components of the real element-distinctness region. This is a topology result, independent of building a machine model. |
| 14.15 (Ben-Or) | 260 / 276 | **Endpoint not located; model convention needed.** The draft bound is $C(W)=\Omega(\log\max\{\kappa(W),\kappa(\mathbb R^n\setminus W)\}-n)$. Tree operations, branch costs and the component-count convention must be fixed first. |
| 14.16 | 261 / 277 | **Endpoint not located; depends on the tree model.** At depth $d$, at most $2^d$ projected pieces given by at most $d$ degree-two constraints with $d$ auxiliary variables, before the stated disequality-elimination step. Existing polynomial syntax alone does not supply this path translation. |
| 14.18 (Milnor–Thom consequence) | 261 / 277 | **Endpoint not located.** The displayed bound is $\kappa(S)\le D(2D-1)^{n+h-1}$ for degree-$D$ constraints in $n$ variables, with $m$ equalities and $h$ inequalities, independent of $m$. Exact constraint/degree hypotheses need a precise source formulation; this is a general mathematics prerequisite for 14.15. |
| 14.23 (BSS) | 264 / 280 | **Endpoint not located; model convention needed.** Completeness of the specified binary-coefficient common-root problem for the binary-input part of nondeterministic complex computation. Polynomial-calculus/Nullstellensatz proof systems do not prove this computational claim. |
| 14.25 | 265 / 281 | **Endpoint not located; source proof needs repair.** Mandelbrot undecidability for the chapter's complex-machine model. The draft's dimension argument cannot be accepted as a general claim about countable unions of semialgebraic sets. |

### What the existing algebraic API establishes

All names in this paragraph are in `Cslib.Circuits.Arithmetic`, except the two explicitly
qualified `Cslib.Circuits.Formula` results.

- [Determinant.lean](../CslibFrontier/Computability/Circuit/Arithmetic/Determinant.lean):
  `exists_circuit_det` bounds the gate count by $3n^4+4$ over a commutative ring;
  `detFamily_mem_VP` supplies membership in circuit-based VP. These are algorithms for the
  determinant, not simulations of every small circuit by a small determinant.
- [DeterminantalComplexity.lean](../CslibFrontier/Computability/Circuit/Arithmetic/DeterminantalComplexity.lean):
  `isProjection_permanent_det_two_pow_sub_one` represents the size-$n$ permanent by a determinant
  of dimension $2^n-1$ over every commutative ring. Its module documentation explicitly leaves
  general determinantal universality unformalized.
- [Permanent.lean](../CslibFrontier/Computability/Circuit/Arithmetic/Permanent.lean):
  `permFamily_mem_VNP` proves membership over every commutative ring, not hardness.
- [Permanent/Formula.lean](../CslibFrontier/Computability/Circuit/Arithmetic/Permanent/Formula.lean):
  `Cslib.Circuits.Formula.isProjection_permanent` and `isProjection_permanent_toCircuit` simulate
  a formula by dimension `F.size + 1`, over every commutative semiring. Here `size` counts
  operation nodes, including constants; sharing a subexpression in a circuit is different.
- [Permanent/BooleanSum.lean](../CslibFrontier/Computability/Circuit/Arithmetic/Permanent/BooleanSum.lean):
  `isProjection_booleanSum_entry_permanent` eliminates a selector occurring in exactly one
  entry, using an explicit scalar `half` with `2 * half = 1` and one extra matrix dimension.
  Repeated-selector elimination and full VNP-hardness are explicitly outstanding.

The draft's Definition 14.4 uses formula witnesses for `AlgP`; the library's
[VP](../CslibFrontier/Computability/Circuit/Arithmetic/VP.lean) and
[VNP](../CslibFrontier/Computability/Circuit/Arithmetic/VNP.lean) use circuits. No equivalence
bridge was identified in this audit. The draft's Definition 14.6 also allows only substitutions
from $0,1,x_i$, whereas library `IsProjection` permits arbitrary scalar constants. This matters:
a permanent with only $0,1,x_i$ substituted has nonnegative real coefficients and cannot yield
the constant $-1$, although the preceding draft arithmetic model permits $-1$ as a constant.
The field convention also needs correction: the standard permanent-completeness target in
[#321](https://github.com/cslib-community/cslib-frontier/issues/321) excludes characteristic two;
the draft's bundled statement does not say so. These differences prevent declaring 14.7 covered
merely by finding a similarly named theorem.

### Checked degree obstruction to literal 14.7

The draft says that an arbitrary circuit of size $u$ projects to a determinant “on $u+2$
variables.” Even interpreting $u+2$ generously as matrix dimension fails for unrestricted
circuits: four squarings compute $X^{16}$, but a determinant of dimension at most six has degree
at most six, and variable/scalar projection cannot raise degree.

[AroraBarakAlgebraic.lean](../CslibFrontierTests/AroraBarakAlgebraic.lean) checks this over every
nontrivial commutative ring, using `exists_circuit_pow_two_pow`, `totalDegree_projection_le`
and `totalDegree_det_genericMatrix_le`. The witness has size at most four and is not a
projection of a determinant of dimension **its actual size plus two**. Inputs are free;
these are formal polynomials, not polynomial functions identified by evaluation on a finite
field. Run from the repository root:

```bash
scripts/build.sh --wfail --iofail CslibFrontierTests.AroraBarakAlgebraic
```

A formula/circuit typo is plausible in context, but this audit does not silently replace the
source claim or assert a corrected universality theorem. The draft's lack of a degree bound
makes the unrestricted statement unsuitable as a formalization target.

### Other source and model boundaries

The chapter describes addition/subtraction as free in its computation-tree model but later
uses depth to count leaves and constraints. A formal model must state which branch and
arithmetic operations contribute to depth and why those counting bounds hold. The draft's
Definition 14.13 describes path connectivity; a port using Mathlib's connected components must
supply the relevant equivalence, rather than conflate the notions by definition.

For 14.23, specify input polynomial encodings, allowed field constants, witnesses and the
reduction before claiming BSS completeness. The existing Boolean-root Nullstellensatz
[proof-system results](../CslibFrontier/Logics/Propositional/Algebraic/Boolean.lean) concern
refutations with Boolean axioms, not this common-complex-root decision problem.

For 14.25, the sketch's asserted dimension consequence is invalid for semialgebraic sets in
general: the complex plane, viewed as the real plane, is already semialgebraic of dimension
two. A correct argument needs the precise equality-test/algebraic-machine restrictions and a
suitable topological obstruction. This observation does not refute the intended undecidability
result; it prevents using the draft sketch as a complete proof.

## Remaining audit work

Chapters other than 14 have not been catalogued here. The first implementation milestones for
§22.1 are [#4712](https://github.com/cslib-community/cslib-frontier/pull/4712) and
[#4713](https://github.com/cslib-community/cslib-frontier/pull/4713); the latter distinguishes
the literal unrestricted draft 22.3 from the published theorem with an additive loss.
The full book-wide mapping and corrected density-amplification theorem remain open in
[#4711](https://github.com/cslib-community/cslib-frontier/issues/4711). This chapter audit does
not claim ownership of linked implementation issues or mark the overall objective complete.
